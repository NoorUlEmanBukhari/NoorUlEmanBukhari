### 🚀 Projects I’ve Worked On

- ⚡ **Real-Time Electricity Bill Forecasting System (FYP)**  
  Designed and trained a forecasting model using **Python**, **XGBoost**, working with a dataset of **84,000+ users** across **3 years** of monthly electricity usage.  
  Focused on **feature engineering**, **model training**, and building a **backend pipeline** to support unit predictions — laying the foundation for real-time bill forecasting.

- 🎬 **Movies Recommendation System**  
  Built a **hybrid recommender** using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest movies based on user preferences and ratings, similar to Netflix-style recommendations.

- ❤️ **Heart Disease Prediction**  
  Created a machine learning model using classification algorithms to predict the risk of heart disease from patient data, aimed at early detection and prevention.

- 🏠 **House Sale Price Prediction**  
  Used regression models to predict real estate prices based on features like location, size, and past sales trends.

- 📈 **Apple Stock Price Prediction**  
  Implemented time series forecasting using **LSTM** and other models to predict short-term stock trends. Analyzed single-step and multi-step performance to refine strategy.

- 🧬 **Medical Image Analysis**  
  Applied CNN and deep learning models to classify **histopathological and radiological images** for detecting diseases like **colon and skin cancer**.

- 🤖 **Medical Chatbot (FastAPI + OpenAI/Gemini + FAISS)**  
  Designed a FastAPI-based medical assistant that uses a **custom tokenizer**, **semantic search with FAISS**, and **LLM-based response generation**. Integrated **MongoDB** for storing chat history.

- 💬 **General Chatbot (FastAPI + MongoDB + Gemini)**  
  Built a general-purpose conversational chatbot using **FastAPI** and **Gemini/OpenAI API**, with persistent chat storage using **MongoDB** for enhanced user experience.
